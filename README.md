## Analysing the impact of the 2007-9 global financial crisis on financial market interdependence between developing and emerging economies
This dissertation investigates the impact of the 2007-9 global financial crisis (GFC) on stock price co-movement between the G10 and the BRICS/MINT (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) emerging economies. Using data from DataStream, we test for granger causal relationships between equity indices and whether the GFC decreased interdependence between these two groups of countries. We also explore whether new machine learning techniques such as neural networks allow for the testing of these relationships without functional form restrictions. These findings will be useful to policymakers and investors for portfolio diversification and minimising financial contagion risk.
